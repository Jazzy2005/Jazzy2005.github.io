     Hello, my full name is Jasmine Rawana. I'm 14 years old and I live in Mississauga Ontario. My favourite pastimes are crocheting, playing piano and reading. I also love traveling. I consider myself to be quite creative. My currant book series that i am into is the lunar chronicles. I also enjoy swimming, playing badminton and chess.

     <p>More things about me that you may not know is that I can't eat plain tomatoes. When it comes to food, I have no problem trying new things except if it has tomatoe slices or whole tomatoes. I don't mind tomato sauce or ketchup once in a while. A must when it comes to food is that i can't have shawarma without some sort of heat. It will be too bland for me.

     I have been super lucky to travel a bunch and i am very thankful for that, but if I were to go anywhere in the world that i haven't been, i would love to go to Japan and Thailand.</p>
